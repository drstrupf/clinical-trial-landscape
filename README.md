Unmasking and understanding inequities in the global landscape of industry sponsored clinical trials - see our corresponding [publication in JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812364).

## Summary
Data on **industry funded interventional drug trials for multiple sclerosis** from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ "clinicaltrials.gov") were combined with map and socioeconomic data from [naturalearthdata.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and socioeconomic data from the [United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/UNSDWebsite/) in order to elucidate inequities in access to trials and to illustrate the underrepresentation of people living outside highly developed countries.

<sup>**Figure 1** Log<sub>10</sub>-disproportionality of the expected number of trial sites and the actual number of trial sites in industry funded interventional drug trials in multiple sclerosis from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ "clinicaltrials.gov"), all phases combined. For each country we computed the expected number of trial sites under the assumption that the sites are equally distributed among the world population.</sup>
